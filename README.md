## Weather App with Angular, C# (ASP.NET Core), Tailwind CSS, and SQLite

The Weather App is a versatile tool that provides detailed weather forecasts and historical weather conditions. Users can add and manage different cities, assigning each a unique information text and storing their weather data by date. The app enables the recording of temperature (Â°C), rainfall (mm), and wind speed (m/s), as well as the editing or deletion of these data as needed.

### About

This application serves as a comprehensive weather data management tool. It integrates with the Chart.js library for visualizations, helping users understand weather trends over time. Additionally, it includes integration with the OpenWeather API for real-time weather information from any location.

### Functionality

Users have the ability to:

- `Record Weather Data:` Manually input weather data for different locations including temperature, rainfall, and wind speed.
- `Edit and Delete Entries:` Update or remove previously entered data as required.
- `Visualize Data:` Utilize Chart.js for graphical representation of weather trends.
- `Fetch Real-Time Data:` Seamlessly integrate with OpenWeather API for current weather conditions and forecasts.

### API Interaction

You can use tools like Postman to test the API endpoints. For instance, to fetch all cities, you can use the following GET request:

```plaintext
GET https://localhost:5001/api/cities
```

<b>Integration with Open Weather API</b>

In addition to manual data management, the application integrates with the Open Weather API, which provides real-time weather information. This feature allows users to:

- `Fetch Current Weather Data:` Automatically retrieve and display weather conditions for a chosen location.

### Project Setup

For the root of the API, you could create a basic configuration as follows, for example:

appsettings.json

```json
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Information"
    }
  },
  "AllowedHosts": "*",
  "OpenWeatherSettings": {
    "ApiKey": "<API_KEY>"
  }
}
```

appsettings.Development.json

```json
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning"
    }
  },
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Data source=weatherapp.db"
  },
  "OpenWeatherSettings": {
    "ApiKey": "<API_KEY>"
  }
}
```

### Running the Application

To run the application, start the frontend and backend (API) separately.

In the frontend root directory, install dependencies with:

```
npm install
```

Then, launch the frontend with:

```
ng serve
```

In the Backend / API root directory, ensure the necessary packages are installed with:

```
dotnet restore
```

And then start the backend with:

```
dotnet run
```

### Backend / API Commands

- `dotnet ef database drop` - Drop the existing database
- `dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate` - Create initial database migrations
- `dotnet ef database update` - Apply the database updates
- `dotnet watch` - Start the backend with live reloading
- `dotnet run` - Run the backend

### Note

- It is recommended to configure HTTPS for secure connections when deploying the application to a production environment
- When moving the application to a production environment, database connection settings should be updated to match the production server's configuration
