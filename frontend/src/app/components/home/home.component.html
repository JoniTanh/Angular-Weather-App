        The Weather App is a versatile tool that provides detailed weather
        forecasts and historical weather conditions. Users can add and manage
        different cities, assigning each a unique information text and storing
        their weather data by date. The app enables the recording of temperature
        (Â°C), rainfall (mm), and wind speed (m/s), as well as the editing or
        deletion of these data as needed.

        Visualization is implemented using the Chart.js library, which provides
        a graphical representation of the collected weather data. This helps to
        understand the trends and changes in weather phenomena over time.

        location. This includes data on the current weather condition,
        temperature, feels-like temperature, humidity, air pressure, wind speed
        and direction, and wind gusts.
